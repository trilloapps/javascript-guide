Open a web browser and go to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8000).

### Double-clicking the index.html File:

Navigate to the project directory using a file explorer.
Locate the index.html file in the project directory.
Double-click on the index.html file, and it will open in the default web browser.
This method is straightforward but may not support certain features that require a server environment.

### Using a Live Server Extension:
